# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves modularizing the monolithic `api-old.js` file (1273+ lines) into a feature-based modular architecture while maintaining 100% backward compatibility. The current file contains all API functionality in a single class, making it difficult to maintain, test, and navigate. The modularization will improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience without breaking any existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer using the existing API service, I want all current functionality to work exactly the same after modularization, so that no existing code breaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN all existing method calls SHALL return identical results
2. WHEN components import the main API service THEN they SHALL continue to work without any changes
3. WHEN any method from the original ApiService class is called THEN it SHALL behave identically to the original implementation
4. WHEN error handling occurs THEN it SHALL maintain the same error format and behavior
5. WHEN caching is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same caching behavior and performance

### Requirement 2: Feature-Based Service Organization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want related functionality grouped into logical feature-based services, so that I can easily find and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing services THEN authentication functionality SHALL be grouped in authService
2. WHEN organizing services THEN report functionality SHALL be grouped in reportService  
3. WHEN organizing services THEN admin functionality SHALL be grouped in adminService
4. WHEN organizing services THEN safe zone functionality SHALL be grouped in safeZoneService
5. WHEN organizing services THEN behavior tracking SHALL be grouped in behaviorService
6. WHEN organizing services THEN core HTTP functionality SHALL be in apiClient
7. WHEN organizing services THEN geographic utilities SHALL be in geoUtils

### Requirement 3: Line-by-Line Migration Accuracy

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want every single line of functionality from the original file to be preserved in the modular structure, so that no functionality is lost or duplicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating code THEN every method from the original ApiService class SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN migrating code THEN every utility function SHALL be moved to the appropriate service
3. WHEN migrating code THEN every comment and documentation SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN migrating code THEN every configuration option SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN migrating code THEN every error handling pattern SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN migrating code THEN every caching mechanism SHALL be maintained
7. WHEN migrating code THEN every mathematical calculation SHALL be preserved exactly

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility Guarantee

**User Story:** As a developer with existing components using the API service, I want to continue importing and using the API exactly as before, so that I don't need to refactor any existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the main API service THEN the import statement SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN calling any existing method THEN the method signature SHALL remain identical
3. WHEN using the ApiService class THEN all public methods SHALL be available
4. WHEN accessing properties THEN all existing properties SHALL be available
5. WHEN using destructured exports THEN all existing exports SHALL be available

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer working with the API services, I want the option to import specific services directly, so that I can have better code organization and potentially better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need only authentication features THEN I SHALL be able to import authService directly
2. WHEN I need only report features THEN I SHALL be able to import reportService directly
3. WHEN I need only admin features THEN I SHALL be able to import adminService directly
4. WHEN I need only safe zone features THEN I SHALL be able to import safeZoneService directly
5. WHEN I need multiple services THEN I SHALL be able to import them individually or together

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want each service to have clear responsibilities and minimal dependencies, so that the code is easier to understand, test, and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing service code THEN each service SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN services SHALL have minimal coupling between each other
3. WHEN reading code THEN each service SHALL be self-contained and understandable
4. WHEN testing THEN each service SHALL be testable in isolation
5. WHEN modifying functionality THEN changes SHALL be localized to the relevant service

### Requirement 7: Performance Preservation

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want the API performance to remain the same or improve after modularization, so that the application continues to be responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN response times SHALL not increase
2. WHEN using caching THEN cache performance SHALL be maintained or improved
3. WHEN using batch operations THEN batch performance SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN loading the application THEN initial load time SHALL not increase significantly
5. WHEN using retry mechanisms THEN retry behavior and timing SHALL be identical

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Code Comments

**User Story:** As a developer working with the modularized code, I want comprehensive documentation and preserved comments, so that I can understand the functionality and its intended behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading service files THEN each service SHALL have clear documentation
2. WHEN reviewing methods THEN existing comments SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN understanding functionality THEN JSDoc comments SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN exploring the API THEN usage examples SHALL be available
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN error messages and logging SHALL be preserved
